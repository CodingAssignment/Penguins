Reproducible figures in R Assignment materials 

- Assignment folder contains code ('assignment_1') in rmd file, html, and a pdf of the html. The pdf format works best for immediate and intuitive viewing.
- Assignment contains the sub-folder 'figures' - with png files of the two plots I created.
- Assignment contains the sub-folder 'data' - with the raw and csv file contained within it.
- Assignment contains the sub-folder 'functions' - with two R files for cleaning the data ('cleaning2') and plotting the data ('plotting2') respectively.

- ! The code will not run until you download the Assignment folder and set your working directory to the folder.
